## Introduction

Time series analysis is a crucial aspect of understanding the behavior of financial markets. In this project, we delve into the S&P 500 stock market data, applying various time series analysis techniques to gain insights into trends, patterns, and potential future movements.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis consists of historical S&P 500 stock market data, including daily closing prices, trading volumes, and other relevant metrics.

**Dataset Source:** [Provide the source link or reference to the dataset used]

## Tools and Libraries

- Jupyter Notebook
- Visual Studio Code
- Python
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org)

## Installation

To run the analysis locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Giyanellow/Time-Series-Analysis-on-S-P-500-Stock-Market-Data
   ```

2. Execute the cells in sequential order to run the analysis step by step.

## Analysis Steps

The analysis is structured into the following steps:

1. **Data Loading:** Load the S&P 500 dataset and perform initial exploratory data analysis.
2. **Analysing change in price of the stock overtime:** Decompose the time series into its components (trend, seasonality, and residuals).
3. **Moving Average:** Computation of Moving Average through different time windows.
4. **Closing Price change analysis in apple stock:** Figuring out patterns from apple stock closing
5. **Determining if there is correlation between these companies' closing prices:** Determination of price correlation between the four (4) tech companies.

## Results

The results of the time series analysis will be presented in the Jupyter Notebook, including visualizations, statistical summaries, and insights gained from the analysis.
