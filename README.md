## Introduction

Time series analysis is a crucial aspect of understanding the behavior of financial markets. In this project, we delve into the S&P 500 stock market data, applying various time series analysis techniques to gain insights into trends, patterns, and potential future movements.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis consists of historical S&P 500 stock market data, including daily closing prices, trading volumes, and other relevant metrics.

**Dataset Source:** [Provide the source link or reference to the dataset used]

## Tools and Libraries

- Jupyter Notebook
- Visual Studio Code
- Python
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/)

## Installation

To run the analysis locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sp500-time-series-analysis.git
    cd sp500-time-series-analysis
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `SP-500_Time-Analysis.ipynb` in Visual Studio Code or your preferred Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Execute the cells in sequential order to run the analysis step by step.

## Analysis Steps

The analysis is structured into the following steps:

1. **Data Loading:** Load the S&P 500 dataset and perform initial exploratory data analysis.
2. **Time Series Decomposition:** Decompose the time series into its components (trend, seasonality, and residuals).
3. **Stationarity Check:** Check and enhance stationarity of the time series data.
4. **Modeling:** Apply time series models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, or other suitable models.
5. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance and interpret the results.

## Results

The results of the time series analysis will be presented in the Jupyter Notebook, including visualizations, statistical summaries, and insights gained from the analysis.
